# Project Documentation

This directory contains all documentation for the Modular Frontend project.

## Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized into the following sections:

### General Documentation
- `README.md` - This file
- `TODO.md` - Main project task tracking and roadmap
- `consolidated-todos.md` - Consolidated list of all outstanding TODOs from various subsystems
- `ui-enhancements.md` - Strategy for implementing modern UI styling

### System-Specific Documentation
Each major system has its own directory with relevant documentation:
- `components/` - Component library documentation
- `theme/` - Theme system documentation
- `routing/` - Routing system documentation
- `tabs/` - Tab management system documentation
- `api/` - API integration documentation

### TODO Files
Each major system may have a specific TODO file:
- `TODO.md` - Main project TODO list (high-level overview)
- `consolidated-todos.md` - Consolidated list of all TODOs from all systems
- `components/TODO-components.md` - Component-specific TODOs
- `theme/TODO-theme.md` - Theme system TODOs
- `routing/TODO-routing.md` - Routing system TODOs
- `tabs/TODO-tabs.md` - Tab management TODOs

> **Note:** To simplify task tracking, all active TODOs have been consolidated in the `consolidated-todos.md` file, which should be the primary reference for outstanding tasks.

## Documentation Conventions

- Markdown files use kebab-case for filenames
- Each system directory contains system-specific documentation
- Integration documentation between systems is stored in the `integration/` directory
- Code examples should use syntax highlighting
- Screenshots and diagrams should be stored in the `assets/` directory

## Contributing to Documentation

When contributing to the documentation:
1. Follow the existing structure and conventions
2. Update the consolidated TODOs file when adding/completing tasks
3. Cross-reference related documentation when appropriate
4. Include code examples where helpful
5. Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

## Project Overview

This project follows a modular frontend architecture with a unified theme system, where:

1. **Independent Modules**: Each feature is self-contained and independently enable/disable-able
2. **Loose Coupling**: Modules communicate through well-defined interfaces, not direct dependencies
3. **Feature Isolation**: Features have their own state, UI components, and business logic
4. **Consistent API Boundaries**: All modules expose consistent public APIs
5. **Independent Testing**: Each module is testable in isolation

## Recent Updates

### May 2023: DirectThemeProvider Integration
- Successfully implemented DirectThemeProvider across multiple components
- Fixed testing infrastructure to properly mock themes in component tests
- Resolved HTML structure validation issues in Table component tests
- Fixed Panel component tests to use the correct theme values
- Updated DataDisplayDemo tests to properly handle component mocking
- Identified remaining test issues in ButtonDemo, CustomTabStyles, and ThemePreview components

### April 2023: Tab System Fix
- Fixed DefaultTabManager initialization with TabStorage instance in app.ts
- Ensured proper integration between Tab Manager and Theme System
- Verified application startup with correct tab system initialization
- Created detailed integration documentation

### April 2023: Routing System Implementation
- Implemented React Router for component demos
- Created centralized demo page navigation
- Simplified access to component demos via proper routing
- Improved project organization by removing static HTML endpoints
- Added detailed documentation for the routing system

## Current Focus Areas

1. **Test Infrastructure Improvements**:
   - Fix remaining test failures in ButtonDemo component
   - Resolve CustomTabStyles test failures
   - Repair ThemePreview component tests
   - Address drag-and-drop test issues in TabList component

2. **Theme System Enhancements**:
   - Continue moving components to DirectThemeProvider
   - Ensure type safety across theme implementations
   - Complete documentation for theme migration

3. **Component Architecture**:
   - Ensure all components follow established patterns
   - Validate independent testability of modules
   - Maintain loose coupling between components

## Getting Started

To get started with the project:

1. Review the [Project TODO List](TODO.md) for an overview of completed and upcoming tasks
2. Explore the Core Systems documentation to understand the architectural foundation
3. Check out the Frontend Foundation documentation for UI component guidelines
4. Follow the Development & Operations guides for setup and workflow

## Contributing

When contributing to the project documentation:

1. Follow the established structure and formatting
2. Update relevant TODO files when completing tasks
3. Add detailed information about integration points between systems
4. Include code examples when relevant
5. Update the main README.md (this file) when making significant changes

## Project Status

The project is currently in the Frontend Foundation phase, focusing on:

- Completing the UI component library
- Implementing the layout system
- Setting up the routing infrastructure
- Configuring API integration
- Implementing component architecture best practices
