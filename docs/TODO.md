# Project Roadmap & Task Tracking

> **IMPORTANT REMINDER:** Please reference [UI Enhancement Strategy](docs/ui-enhancements.md) document for implementing modern UI styling.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project follows a strictly modular, self-contained frontend architecture, focusing on:

1. **Independent Modules**: Self-contained and independently enable/disable-able features
2. **Loose Coupling**: Communication through well-defined interfaces
3. **Feature Isolation**: Independent state, UI components, and business logic
4. **Consistent API Boundaries**: Standardized public APIs
5. **Independent Testing**: Modules testable in isolation
