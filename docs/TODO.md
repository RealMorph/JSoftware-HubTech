# Project Roadmap & Task Tracking

> **IMPORTANT REMINDER:** Please reference [UI Enhancement Strategy](docs/ui-enhancements.md) document for implementing modern UI styling.

## 📋 Project Overview

This project follows a strictly modular, self-contained frontend architecture, focusing on:

1. **Independent Modules**: Self-contained and independently enable/disable-able features
2. **Loose Coupling**: Communication through well-defined interfaces
3. **Feature Isolation**: Independent state, UI components, and business logic
4. **Consistent API Boundaries**: Standardized public APIs
5. **Independent Testing**: Modules testable in isolation

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- All components follow modular architecture principles
- Full test coverage for all modules
- Complete documentation for all systems
- Performance benchmarks meet targets
- Accessibility compliance meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- All components use ThemeConfig directly
- Zero "Theme value not found" warnings in production
- Consistent theme access pattern across all components
- Performance monitoring shows Core Web Vitals above 90th percentile
- All critical features have offline fallback capabilities
- Bundle size remains under defined thresholds for each module
- Documentation covers all APIs, components, and user workflows
- Developer guides facilitate quick onboarding for new team members
