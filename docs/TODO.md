# Project Roadmap & Task Tracking

> **IMPORTANT REMINDER:** Please reference [UI Enhancement Strategy](docs/ui-enhancements.md) document for implementing modern UI styling. It contains detailed guidance on the styling architecture, theme enhancement, component refactoring approach, and implementation timeline.

## üìã Project Overview

This project follows a strictly modular, self-contained frontend architecture, focusing on:

1. **Independent Modules**: Self-contained and independently enable/disable-able features
2. **Loose Coupling**: Communication through well-defined interfaces
3. **Feature Isolation**: Independent state, UI components, and business logic
4. **Consistent API Boundaries**: Standardized public APIs
5. **Independent Testing**: Modules testable in isolation

### Current Systems Status

- ‚úÖ **Theme System** - Direct theme consumption architecture complete
- ‚úÖ **State Management** - Modular state services implemented
- ‚úÖ **Tab Management** - Self-contained tab system complete
- ‚úÖ **Routing System** - Complete and operational
- ‚úÖ **Build System** - Supporting modular builds
- [ ] **UI Components Library** - ~95% complete
- [ ] **Layout System** - ~95% complete
- [ ] **API Integration** - ~40% complete

## Animation System Design

### Animation Theme Properties
```typescript
// To be added to ThemeConfig
animations: {
  durations: {
    instant: '0ms',
    fastest: '100ms',
    fast: '200ms',
    normal: '300ms', 
    slow: '500ms',
    slowest: '800ms',
  },
  easings: {
    linear: 'linear',
    easeIn: 'cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 1, 1)',
    easeOut: 'cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.2, 1)',
    easeInOut: 'cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)',
  },
  transitions: {
    default: 'all {{durations.normal}} {{easings.easeInOut}}',
    fade: 'opacity {{durations.normal}} {{easings.easeInOut}}',
    transform: 'transform {{durations.normal}} {{easings.easeOut}}',
    background: 'background-color {{durations.slow}} {{easings.easeInOut}}',
    color: 'color {{durations.fast}} {{easings.easeOut}}',
    height: 'height {{durations.normal}} {{easings.easeInOut}}',
    width: 'width {{durations.normal}} {{easings.easeInOut}}',
    maxHeight: 'max-height {{durations.normal}} {{easings.easeInOut}}',
    spacing: 'margin {{durations.normal}} {{easings.easeInOut}}, padding {{durations.normal}} {{easings.easeInOut}}',
    border: 'border {{durations.fast}} {{easings.easeInOut}}',
    shadow: 'box-shadow {{durations.normal}} {{easings.easeInOut}}',
  },
  presets: {
    // Common animation combinations
    buttonHover: {
      properties: ['background-color', 'box-shadow', 'transform'],
      duration: '{{durations.fast}}',
      easing: '{{easings.easeOut}}',
      transform: 'scale(1.03)',
    },
    fadeIn: {
      properties: ['opacity'],
      from: 0,
      to: 1,
      duration: '{{durations.normal}}',
      easing: '{{easings.easeOut}}',
    },
    fadeOut: {
      properties: ['opacity'],
      from: 1,
      to: 0,
      duration: '{{durations.normal}}',
      easing: '{{easings.easeIn}}',
    },
    slideIn: {
      properties: ['transform', 'opacity'],
      from: { transform: 'translateY(20px)', opacity: 0 },
      to: { transform: 'translateY(0)', opacity: 1 },
      duration: '{{durations.normal}}',
      easing: '{{easings.easeOut}}',
    },
    // More presets as needed
  }
}
```

### Integration Strategy

The animation system will be designed to work with both:
1. **Styled-components** - For CSS transitions/animations
2. **Framer Motion** - For more complex animations (optional dependency)

All animations will be configurable through the theme and respect user preferences for reduced motion. The system will provide sensible defaults while allowing for customization where needed.

## Notes
- Each module has its own detailed TODO list in its respective markdown file
- Regular updates to these lists will be made as the project evolves
- All work should follow the architectural principles outlined above
