## Modular Architecture Principles

This project follows a strictly modular, self-contained frontend architecture, where:

1. **Independent Modules**: Each feature must be self-contained and independently enable/disable-able without breaking other features
2. **Loose Coupling**: Modules should communicate through well-defined interfaces, not direct dependencies
3. **Feature Isolation**: Features should be isolated with their own state, UI components, and business logic
4. **Consistent API Boundaries**: All modules should expose consistent public APIs 
5. **Independent Testing**: Each module must be testable in isolation from other modules

## Core Systems Status

### Completed Core Systems
- Theme System - Modular theme management with direct theme consumption
- State Management - Modular state services
- Tab Management - Self-contained tab system
- Build System - Supports modular builds

### Current Frontend Systems
- [ ] **UI Components Library** - ~75% complete
- [ ] **Layout System** - ~90% complete
- **Routing System** - Completed
- [ ] **API Integration** - ~40% complete
