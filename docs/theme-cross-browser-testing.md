# Theme System Cross-Browser Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the testing plan for verifying the theme system's functionality and appearance across different browsers and devices. The goal is to ensure consistent theme behavior regardless of the browser or platform used.

## Test Environments

### Desktop Browsers
- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Edge (latest)
- [ ] Opera (latest)

### Mobile Browsers
- [ ] Chrome for Android
- [ ] Safari for iOS
- [ ] Samsung Internet

### Devices/Screen Sizes
- [ ] Large desktop (1920×1080+)
- [ ] Standard desktop (1366×768)
- [ ] Tablet (768×1024)
- [ ] Mobile (375×667)

## Test Cases

### Theme Application
- [ ] Verify default theme is correctly applied on initial load
- [ ] Check that theme colors are applied to all components
- [ ] Verify that typography styles (font family, size, weight) are correctly applied
- [ ] Validate spacing values are consistently applied across components
- [ ] Ensure shadow effects render properly

### Theme Switching
- [ ] Test toggling between light and dark themes
- [ ] Verify all components update correctly with theme changes
- [ ] Check for any flickering or visual artifacts during theme transition
- [ ] Confirm theme persistence through page navigation
- [ ] Test theme switching with keyboard navigation (accessibility)

### Responsive Behavior
- [ ] Validate breakpoint-specific theme properties are applied correctly
- [ ] Test resizing window to trigger responsive layout changes
- [ ] Verify theme properties adapt to different screen sizes
- [ ] Check mobile-specific theme adjustments

### Performance
- [ ] Measure time to initial render with theme applied
- [ ] Test performance during theme switching
- [ ] Check for any layout shifts when theme properties are applied
- [ ] Monitor memory usage during extended theme interaction

### Browser-Specific Issues
- [ ] Test for CSS rendering differences between browsers
- [ ] Verify CSS custom properties support and fallbacks
- [ ] Check for vendor-specific CSS issues
- [ ] Validate font rendering across different browsers

## Testing Process

1. **Setup**
   - Create test matrix with all browser/device combinations
   - Prepare screenshots for reference comparisons
   - Install necessary browser extensions for testing

2. **Visual Comparison**
   - Take screenshots of key components in each browser
   - Compare screenshots for visual discrepancies
   - Document any differences with detailed notes

3. **Interactive Testing**
   - Complete a standard set of user journeys in each browser
   - Test all theme-related interactions (switching, responsive behavior)
   - Document any behavioral differences

4. **Performance Analysis**
   - Measure load times and performance metrics in each browser
   - Compare theme switching performance across browsers
   - Identify any browser-specific performance issues

## Reporting

Create a detailed report with:
- Test environment details (browser versions, OS versions)
- Screenshots showing any discrepancies
- Performance metrics comparison
- Issue severity classification
- Recommendations for fixes or improvements

## Known Browser-Specific Issues

| Browser | Issue | Workaround/Solution | Status |
|---------|-------|---------------------|--------|
| Safari | Slow transition effects | Optimize transition properties | To be fixed |
| IE11 | Custom properties not supported | Use preprocessor fallbacks | Not supported |
| Firefox | Font weight rendering differences | Adjust font-weight values | To be fixed |

## Automation

Consider implementing automated visual regression testing with:
- Cypress for functional testing
- Percy or BackstopJS for visual regression
- BrowserStack for cross-browser compatibility

## Follow-up Actions

After testing is complete:
1. Prioritize identified issues
2. Create tickets for browser-specific bugs
3. Update browser support documentation
4. Implement fixes and re-test
