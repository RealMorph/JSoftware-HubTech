# Authentication System Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for completing the authentication system in our application. The core infrastructure for authentication is largely in place, including token management, authentication services, and React integration components. This plan focuses on finalizing the implementation and ensuring all components use the authentication system correctly.

## Current Status
- ✅ Enhanced Token Management is complete
  - In-memory access token storage
  - Secure refresh token handling
  - Token expiration tracking
  - JWT token decoding and validation

- ✅ API Client Improvements are complete
  - Automatic token refresh mechanism
  - Request queue for handling expired tokens
  - Error handling for authentication failures
  - Centralized redirection for authentication errors

- ✅ Core Authentication Service is complete
  - OAuth-compliant token flow
  - User profile management
  - Login/logout processes
  - Password reset functionality implemented in service

- ✅ React Integration Components are complete
  - AuthProvider context
  - useAuth hook
  - ProtectedRoute component
  - Permission-based access control

## Implementation Progress

### Progress Update (April 19, 2025)
- ✅ Created implementation plan document
- ✅ Created utility scripts for finding localStorage usage
- ✅ Created utility scripts for testing token refresh flow
- ✅ Created RegisterForm component using AuthProvider
- ✅ Created PasswordResetForm and PasswordResetConfirmationForm components
- ✅ Created comprehensive usage documentation for authentication system
- ✅ Replaced direct localStorage access with TokenService in key components:
  - Updated StoreProvider to use TokenService
  - Updated authSlice to use TokenService

### Remaining Tasks

#### 1. Backend API Verification
- [ ] Verify the backend API supports JWT refresh token pattern
  - [ ] Test token refresh endpoint (/auth/refresh)
  - [ ] Ensure refresh tokens have appropriate expiration times
  - [ ] Confirm API returns proper error codes for authentication failures
  - [ ] Test token revocation endpoint (/auth/logout)

#### 2. Component Authentication Integration
- [ ] Identify all components requiring authentication state
  - [ ] Profile component
  - [ ] Dashboard component
  - [ ] Settings components
  - [ ] Any other components with restricted access
- [ ] Update each component to use the useAuth hook instead of direct authentication checks
  ```tsx
  // Before
  const isLoggedIn = localStorage.getItem('token') !== null;
  
  // After
  const { isAuthenticated, user } = useAuth();
  ```

#### 3. Replace Direct localStorage Access
- [x] Create script to find direct localStorage references to authentication tokens
- [x] Update key components to use TokenService
  - [x] StoreProvider
  - [x] authSlice  
- [ ] Find and replace any remaining direct localStorage usage for authentication

#### 4. Authentication Flow Implementation
- [x] Complete Registration Flow
  - [x] Create registration form component
  - [x] Implement form validation
  - [x] Connect to AuthProvider's register method
  - [x] Add success/error handling
  - [x] Implement post-registration redirect

- [x] Complete Password Reset Flow
  - [x] Create password reset request form
  - [x] Create password reset confirmation form
  - [x] Implement email verification token handling
  - [x] Connect to AuthProvider's resetPassword method
  - [x] Add success/error handling
  - [x] Implement post-reset redirect

#### 5. Security Best Practices Verification
- [ ] Confirm in-memory token storage for sensitive tokens
  - [ ] Verify access tokens are not stored in localStorage
  - [ ] Verify only refresh tokens are persisted
  
- [ ] Test automatic token refresh before expiration
  - [ ] Verify token refresh scheduling works properly
  - [ ] Test that expired tokens trigger refresh
  
- [ ] Validate error handling for authentication failures
  - [ ] Test behavior when token refresh fails
  - [ ] Verify proper redirection to login page
  
- [ ] Verify React context usage for state management
  - [ ] Ensure no authentication state exists outside the AuthProvider
  - [ ] Test that authentication state updates propagate correctly

#### 6. Additional Enhancements
- [ ] Implement "Remember Me" functionality
  - [ ] Add option to login form
  - [ ] Modify token storage behavior based on selection
  
- [ ] Add loading states for authentication operations
  - [ ] Show loading indicators during login/logout/register operations
  - [ ] Add fallback UI during authentication checks

- [ ] Implement session timeout handling
  - [ ] Add user inactivity detection
  - [ ] Implement automatic logout after timeout
  - [ ] Add warning notification before timeout
